# Salesforce Logger

I know, yet another logger framework? I undersand it, but I wanted to have simple logging framework providing rich logging features. This logging framework is litertally one Apex class and an optional custom LWC (mostly taken from apex-unified-logging).

Features are mostly inspired by log4j tailort to Salesforce platform.
